## Back End Basics 

### Project 12 @ Practicum WebDev

We will begin to create the backend of our Around The US project, using Node.js.

Standard project structure, routing. JSON files to emulate a DB.
Some groundwork laid so that a future update will add auxilary js file with middleware to make everything cleaner and more succinct.
